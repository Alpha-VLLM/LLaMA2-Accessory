Question: A father is building a playset for his son and needs to purchase lumber, nails, and fabric.  When he started planning the project, the necessary lumber cost $450, the nails cost $30, and the fabric cost $80.  However, recent economic inflation has caused the price of lumber to increase by 20%, the price of nails to increase by 10%, and the price of fabric to increase by 5%.  In dollars, how much more money will it cost to complete the project now (after inflation) than it would have when the father began planning?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
First, the initial, pre-inflation, cost of the project was 450 + 30 + 80 = $560.
Then, the price of the lumber increased to 450*1.20 = $540.
Similarly, the price of the nails increased to 30*1.10 = $33.
And the price of the fabric increased to 80*1.05 = $84.
Therefore, the new, post-inflation, cost of the project is 540 + 33 + 84 = $657.
Thus, the cost has increased by 657 - 560 = $97.
The answer is 97

Question: Linda makes and sells necklaces at craft fairs. At her most recent fair she sold 4 necklaces and 8 rings for a total of $80. If each necklace costs $12, how much does each ring cost?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Let’s use r for the cost of each necklace
4*12+8*r=80
48+8*r=80
8*r=80-48=32
8r=32
r=4 dollars for each ring
The answer is 4

Question: Tree Elementary School is raising money for a new playground. Mrs. Johnson’s class raised $2300, which is twice the amount that Mrs. Sutton’s class raised. Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. How much money did the school raise for the playground if 2% will be deducted for administration fees?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Find the amount Mrs. Sutton’s class raised by dividing $2300 by 2. $2300/2 = $1150
Find the amount Miss Rollin’s class raised by multiplying $1150 by 8. $1150 x 8 = $9200
Multiply $9200 by 3 to find the total amount raised. $9200 x 3 = $27600
Convert 2% to decimal. 2/100 = 0.02
Multiply $27600 by 0.02 to find the administration fees. $27600 x 0.02 = $552
Subtract the administration fee from the total amount raised. $27600 - $552 = $27048
The answer is 27048

Question: John buys 500 newspapers.  Each newspaper sells for $2.  He sells 80% of them.  He buys them all for 75% less than the price at which he sells them.  How much profit does he make?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
He sells 500*.8=400 newspapers
He sells them for 400*2=$800
He gets a discount of 2*.75=$1.5 on the newspapers
So he buys them for 2-1.5=$.5
So he spent 500*.5=$250 buying them
That means he made a profit of 800-250=$550
The answer is 550

Question: Joe buys 3 oranges, 7 juices, 3 jars of honey, and 4 plants at the market. The fruit costs $4.50 each, the juice was 50 cents each, the jars of honey were $5, and the plants were 2 for $18. How much does Joe spend at the market?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Joe spends 4.50*3 = 13.50 on oranges.
Joe spends 7*0.5 = 3.50 on juice.
Joe spends 3*5 = 15 on honey.
Each plant costs 18/2 = 9 dollars.
Joe spends 9*4 = 36 on plants.
Joe spends a total of 13.50+3.50+15+36 = 68 dollars at the market.
The answer is 68

Question: Carter usually bakes 6 cheesecakes, 5 muffins, and 8 red velvet cakes regularly for a week. For this week he was able to bake triple the number of cheesecakes, muffins, chocolate moist cakes, and red velvet cakes. How much more cakes was Carter able to bake for this week?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
Carter can make 6 + 5 + 8 = 19 cakes regularly for a week.
For this week, he made 6 x 3 = 18 cheesecakes.
He made 5 x 3 = 15 muffins.
And also made 8 x 3 = 24 red velvet cakes.
Carter was able to make 18 + 15 + 24 = 57 cakes for this week.
Therefore, Carter was able to make 57 - 19 = 38 more cakes for this week.
The answer is 38

Question: Four adults with 32 teeth went to the dentist for a checkup after realizing they were having severe tooth pain. They were found to have different numbers of damaged teeth, and each person had some teeth removed. The first person had 1/4 of all his teeth removed, and the second person had 3/8 of his teeth removed, the third person had half of his teeth removed, while the last person only had 4 teeth removed. What's the total number of teeth removed at the dental clinic?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The first person had 1/4 of all his teeth removed, a total of 1/4*32 = 8 teeth.
The second person had 3/8 of his teeth removed, meaning 3/8*32 = 12 of his teeth were removed.
Together, the first and the second person had 12+8 = 20 teeth removed in total.
The third person had half of his teeth removed, which were 1/2*32 = 16 teeth.
The first three people had a total of 20+16 = 36 teeth removed from their mouth.
The last person only had 4 teeth removed, bringing the total number of teeth removed at the dentist clinic to be 36+4 = 40 teeth.
The answer is 40

Question: Joy fosters dogs.  The mom foster dog eats 1.5 cups of food, three times a day.  The puppies each eat 1/2 cup of food, twice a day.  There are 5 puppies.  How much food will Joy need for the next 6 days?
Answer: Let's think step by step.
The mom dog eats 1.5 cups of food * 3 = 4.5 cups per day.
For 6 days the mom dog will need 6 * 4.5 cups = 27 cups of food.
The puppies eat 1/2 cup of food * 2 = 1 cup per day.
There are 5 puppies * 1 cup = 5 cups per day for the puppies.
For the 6 days, the puppies will need 5 cups * 6 = 30 cups of food.
Combined the dogs will need 27 cups + 30 cups = 57 cups.
The answer is 57
